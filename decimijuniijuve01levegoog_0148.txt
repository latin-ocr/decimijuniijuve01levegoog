Juvenal, in this Satire, indulges his honest indignabor agninae
Crispinus and his employer Domitian.

After describin some of the enormous crimes of Crispinus, the
poet makes e redientrensitiou to his extravagance and gluttony‚
and thereby takes occasion to describe a ridiculous consultaticn,
held by Domitian over e turbet, which was too large to be con-
tained in any dish, that could he found. After along delibera·
tion among the senatormit was proposed, that the fish should be
autin pieoes end thus cooked3 hut at last the opinion of the sen-
atorMontanus prevailed, thet it should he dressed whole, end that
a dish, large enough to contain it, should be made expresely for
the purpose of receivi' it. ·

The council is then ismissed, and the Satire concludes with a
most severe censure on the emperor’s cruelty an'd injustice to-
wards some nithe hest and most worth of the Romans. -
